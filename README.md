Project Overview
Aim
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of employee attrition in a company. By analyzing HR data, the model will classify employees into categories such as "likely to stay" or "likely to leave."

Description
Employee attrition, or turnover, is a critical issue faced by many organizations, affecting productivity and costs. This project involves using historical HR data to build a predictive model that identifies employees who are at risk of leaving the company. The model will help HR departments take proactive measures to retain valuable talent.

Technologies
Python: The primary programming language used for data manipulation, analysis, and model development.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and cleaning.
Scikit-learn: Employed for building and evaluating machine learning models.
Additional Technologies: You are encouraged to explore and integrate other technologies or libraries you are familiar with, such as NumPy, Matplotlib, or Seaborn for data visualization, or advanced libraries like XGBoost or LightGBM for model enhancement.
